Audiovizz
=========

A package of scripts to help with the (non-realtime) visualization of audio.


Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

Vizzy is best run with python3. In fact, i doubt it does run on python2.7
without modifications.

- [opencv](https://opencv.org/) (with python bindings installed)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [drawSvg](https://pypi.org/project/drawSvg/)

this is best handled by pip, or your system's package manager or by setting up
a virtualenv.
